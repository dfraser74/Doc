The layout of the windows in our tool is completely customizable. Windows can be moved around, resized and are either docked into the main window or floating over it. Undocking a window can be done by pressing ![Undock](../neuromoreStudio/Images/UI/DockUndockHover.png) located at the top right. In order to dock it back press ![Dock](../neuromoreStudio/Images/UI/DockDockHover.png). Undocked windows show a maximize  and a pin button ![Maximize](../neuromoreStudio/Images/UI/DockMaximizeHover.png). The pin button enables and disables the ability to dock a window into the main window. While moving the window around, possible docking locations are highlighted and the windows align automatically.
