#OpenBCI

![OpenBCI](../neuromoreStudio/Images/Biosensors/OpenBCI.png)

neuromore Studio currently only supports the 8/32-bit OpenBCI with 8-channels (without Daisy module).

Please follow the official [OpenBCI on Windows](http://docs.openbci.com/tutorials/10-OpenBCI_on_Windows) and [Fixing FTDI for OSX](http://docs.openbci.com/tutorials/09-Mac_FTDI_Driver_Fix) before using it with neuromore Studio.

neuromore Studio will automatically detect the OpenBCI and show it in the interface.

Supported Platforms: Windows, OSX

First, please pair your Muse to your PC or Mac.

Press 'Tools'->'Start Muse IO' in neuromore Studio before connecting a Muse. This will open up a little data acquisition tool that forwards data from a Muse to neuromore Studio.

Please note that a special Muse IO version is required to run it with OSX. There is a bug in the latest official Muse IO with the Muse number OSC prefixes. Please contact us in case you want to use a Muse on your Mac.

Supported Platforms: Windows, OSX

The OSX version of neuromore Studio supports all kinds of Bluetooth LE heart rate sensors. Just power on your Bluetooth LE heart rate sensor and neuromore Studio will automatically detect it. This can sometimes take up to a minute. In case it doesn't find heart rate sensor, try turning it off and on again.
