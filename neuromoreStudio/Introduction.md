# What is neuromore Studio?

**In short, neuromore Studio is a bio-data acquisition, processing and visualization software, all in one.**

neuromore Studio is a platform that allows you to easily build interactive end-to-end neuro-/ bio-feedback applications and data analysis pipelines - without writing a single line of code!

Using the visual node-based interface you can connect a wide variety of biosensors such as EEG headsets (e.g. OpenBCI, Interaxon Muse 2, Emotiv Epoc, etc.) or heart rate monitors to your application and build complex signal processing pipelines on their incoming data.
Finally, the output of this system is connected to outputs such as vizualization windows, external tiggers, etc.
