When starting neuromore Studio the first time, it will ask you for your user account and your password. Please enter either your e-mail address or your user account name and your password into the given fields and press 'Sign In'.

In case you want neuromore Studio to remember your login information for the next time, enable the 'Remember Me' checkbox before signing in. Your login information will be stored using AES256 encryption on your local disk.

You can sign out via the 'Help' menu entry 'Sign Out'. This will also destroy the encrypted login information on your local disk. Next time you start neuromore Studio you will be prompted to enter your login information again.
